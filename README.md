> Most of the hour spend on this application were focused on setting up the routes and connecting the path while also working setup server.js in the root directory. I also utilize helpers like uuid for unique ID number and also utils for readfromFile, writeToFile,readAndAppend. this help me save alot of extra code that I had to do manually. After checking on all setup requirement, I was able to connect the database to the routes and path.
